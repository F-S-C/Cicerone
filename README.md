## The Authors

_Cicerone_ was created as an exam's project by the group [**_F.S.C. &mdash; Five Students of Computer Science_**](https://github.com/F-S-C), made of:

- [Alessandro **Annese**](https://github.com/Ax3lFernus)
- [Andrea **Esposito**](https://github.com/espositoandrea)
- [Graziano **Montanaro**](https://github.com/prewarning)
- [Regina **Zaccaria**](https://github.com/ReginaZaccaria)

### The Exam

The exam for which this project was created is the one of **Software Engineering** (in Italian: *"Ingegneria del Software"*) of the second year of the Degree Course in _Computer Science and Digital Communication_ of the University of Bari "Aldo Moro", held by Prof. Danilo _Caivano_.

## Information About the System

The entire system was built using **Java** _(for Android)_, **PHP** and the <abbr title="DataBase Management System">DBMS</abbr> **MySQL**.

### The Repository

In this repository there are:

- The system source code
- The online documentation ([Android](https://f-s-c.github.io/Cicerone/Android/index.html) | [Server](https://f-s-c.github.io/Cicerone/Server/index.html))
- The static "brochure" website ([go to the website](https://f-s-c.github.io/Cicerone/))
